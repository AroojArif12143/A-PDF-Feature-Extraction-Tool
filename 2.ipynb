The distribution of\\nBMD varies across populations and is shaped by both environmental and genetic factors. Because the candidate gene\\nvitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) generates vitamin K quinone, a cofactor for the gamma-\\ncarboxylation of bone-related proteins such as osteocalcin, we hypothesized that VKORC1 genetic variants may be\\nassociated with BMD and osteoporosis in the general population. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped six VKORC1 SNPs in\\n7,159 individuals from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). NHANES III is a nationally\\nrepresentative sample linked to health and lifestyle variables including BMD, which was measured using dual energy x-ray\\nabsorptiometry (DEXA) on four regions of the proximal femur. In adjusted models stratified by race/ethnicity and sex, SNPs\\nrs9923231 and rs9934438 were associated with increased BMD (p = 0.039 and 0.024, respectively) while rs8050894 was\\nassociated with decreased BMD (p = 0.016) among non-Hispanic black males (n = 619). VKORC1 rs2884737 was associated\\nwith decreased BMD among Mexican-American males (n = 795; p = 0.004). We then tested for associations between VKORC1\\nSNPs and osteoporosis, but the results did not mirror the associations observed between VKORC1 and BMD, possibly due to\\nsmall numbers of cases. This is the first report of VKORC1 common genetic variation associated with BMD, and one of the\\nfew reports available that investigate the genetics of BMD and osteoporosis in diverse populations.\\n\\nCitation: Crawford DC, Brown-Gentry K, Rieder MJ (2010) VKORC1 Common Variation and Bone Mineral Density in the Third National Health and Nutrition\\nExamination Survey.

Thus, VKORC1 has broad implications\\nfor clotting, a property well-appreciated: even before the gene was\\nidentified, VKOR has\\nlong been the target of warfarin, a\\ncommonly prescribed anticoagulant used to prevent stroke and\\nother thromboembolic events. It is now known that rare mutations\\nin VKORC1 cause warfarin resistance, and common polymor-\\nphisms in VKORC1 account a large proportion of the variability of\\nwarfarin dosing in most populations studied [3].\\n\\nIn addition to having broad effects on the coagulation cascade,\\nthe vitamin K cycle is also essential in the formation of the bone\\nmatrix. Vitamin K, which is synthesized by plants (K1) and\\nis a required co-enzyme for the c-\\nbacteria in the gut (K2),\\ncarboxylation of three glutamic acid (Glu) residues in osteocalcin,\\nconverting them to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). This post-\\ntranslational Glu to Gla modification of osteocalcin, a bone and\\n\\ndentin protein produced by osteoblasts, is necessary for calcium\\nbinding. Evidence suggests that vitamin K1 deficiency is associated\\nwith decreased BMD [4,5] and that high-dose vitamin K\\nsupplementation prevents fractures in at-risk patients [6]. Also,\\nsome inconsistent evidence suggests\\nlong-term warfarin\\ntherapy, which by design inhibits the vitamin K cycle and\\nprevents the Glu to Gla modification, is associated with low BMD\\nin patients compared with patients not on warfarin-therapy [5,7].\\nThis latter observation in humans, however, is not supported by\\nrecent experiments in male rhesus macaques that demonstrate\\nlong-term warfarin therapy does not affect BMD while on a diet\\nhigh in calcium and vitamin D [8].\\n\\nthat\\n\\nDespite the discordant observations between humans and\\nmacaques, preliminary studies in humans suggest that VKORC1\\ncommon variation is associated with mean undercarboyxlated\\nosteocalcin [9] and dietary vitamin K intake [9,10]. Based on role\\nof VKORC1 in the vitamin K cycle and based on the preliminary\\ndata presented in other studies, we hypothesized that common\\nVKORC1 genetic variation is associated with BMD in humans. To\\ntest this hypothesis, we genotyped six VKORC1 SNPs (rs9923231,\\nrs9934438, rs2359612, rs8050894, rs2884737, rs7294)\\nin the\\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\\n(NHANES III) and tested for associations with measures of\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org\\n\\n1\\n\\nDecember 2010 | Volume 5 |\\n\\nIssue 12 | e15088\\n\\n\\x0cBMD. Four of these tagSNPs (rs9923231, rs9934438, rs2359612,\\nand rs8050894) are known to be in strong linkage disequilibrium\\nwith one another and are associated with warfarin dosing in\\npopulations of European-descent [3,11,12]. We also tested for\\nassociations between VKORC1 SNPs and osteoporosis, an extreme\\nphenotype of BMD. Unadjusted and adjusted results suggest that\\nVKORC1 SNPs are associated with these bone phenotypes in\\nhuman, but their effect size is likely small compared with other\\ngenetic and non-genetic factors.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\n\\nStudy Population\\n\\nParticipants were consented by the Centers for Disease Control\\nand Prevention (CDC) at the time of the survey and sample\\ncollection, and consent included the storage of data and biological\\nspecimens such as blood for future research [13]. The present\\nstudy was approved by the CDC Ethics Review Board. Because\\nthe study investigators did not have access to personal identifiers,\\nthis study was considered non-human subjects research by the\\nVanderbilt University Internal Review Board.\\n\\nNHANES III was conducted between 1988 and 1994 by the\\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at\\nthe CDC.\\nNHANES is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey\\ndesigned to represent non-institutionalized Americans at the time\\nof ascertainment [14,15]. NHANES is also a complex, multi-stage\\nsurvey that oversamples minorities (non-Hispanic blacks and\\nMexican-Americans), children, and the elderly. Sampling weights\\nare calculated and provided for analysis to account for non-\\nresponse bias and to adjust for the oversampling of specific groups\\nso that all estimates are nationally representative. All participants\\nwere asked to complete a household interview and physical\\nexamination in the Mobile Examination Center (MEC). If the\\nparticipant was not able to visit the MEC, a home examination\\nwas arranged. During Phase 2 of NHANES III (1991–1994), cell\\nlines were established from blood samples of participants .12\\nyears of age. The total number of NHANES III phase 2\\nparticipants was 16,530, and sample weights were recalculated\\nusing methods previously described [16] for participants with\\nDNA samples to avoid non-response bias. NHANES III DNA\\nsamples became available to study investigators beginning in 2002\\n[13,17–19].\\n\\nthe trochanter region (gm/cm2),\\n\\nBMD of the proximal femur was measured during the physical\\nexam on non-pregnant female and male participants at least 20\\nyears of age using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [20].\\nBone mineral content and BMD are available for the femur neck\\nregion (gm/cm2),\\nthe inter-\\ntrochanter region (gm/cm2), the Ward’s triangle region (gm/cm2),\\nand the total region (gm/cm2). Cotinine levels were determined in\\nparticipants using STC Diagnostics cotinine enzyme immunoassay\\n(EIA) kits\\n(Bethlehem, PA). Serum vitamin D levels were\\ndetermined in participants using the DiaSorin radioimmunoassay\\n(RIA) kit (formerly the INCSTAR 25-OH-D assay; Stillwater,\\nMN) [21].\\n\\nGenotyping\\n\\nNHANES III DNA samples were distributed as aliquots of\\ncrude cell\\nlysates to study investigators. NHANES III DNA\\nconcentrations vary and are estimated to range from 7.5–65 ng/\\nmL with an average of approximately four micrograms in 100 ul.\\nNHANES III DNA samples are distributed in 96-well plates along\\nwith four 96-well plates of CDC-supplied blinded duplicates and\\nblank controls. NHANES III experimental DNA samples are\\nrandomly distributed across plates without regard to race/\\n\\nVKORC1 and Bone Mineral Density in NHANES III\\n\\nseveral major racial/ethnic groups,\\n\\nethnicity, sex, or case/control status. NHANES III DNA samples\\nrepresent\\nincluding non-\\n(n = 2,018),\\nHispanic whites\\nMexican-Americans (n = 2,073), and other racial/ethnic groups\\n(n = 437).\\n\\n(n = 2,631), non-Hispanic blacks\\n\\nTagSNPs were selected using LDselect [22] and the MultiPop-\\nTagSelect algorithm [23] as previously described [3] for non-\\nHispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. A total of 16 tagSNPs\\nwere considered for genotyping. VKORC1 rs17880887 could not\\nbe successfully converted into a genotyping assay and was omitted\\nfrom further genotyping attempts. Five tagSNPs were targeted for\\ngenotyping because they represent the vast majority of common\\nvariation in European-descent populations [3]. These five tagSNPs\\nalso represent the haplotypes associated with warfarin dosing in\\nboth non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks [12,24]. A\\nsixth SNP (rs9923231), which is redundant with rs9934438 in both\\nnon-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, was targeted for\\ngenotyping given that there is evidence this is the functional SNP\\nin the association with warfarin dosing [11,25].\\n\\n(Foster City, CA) except\\n\\nA total of six SNPs were genotyped in 7,159 DNA samples in\\nNHANES III: rs9923231, rs9934438, rs8050894, rs2359612,\\nrs2884737, and rs7294 (Table 1 and Table S1). All SNPs were\\ngenotyped using Applied Biosystem’s TaqManH SNP Genotyping\\nAssays\\nfor rs2884737, which was\\niPLEXH Gold coupled with\\ngenotyped using Sequenom’s\\nMassARRAY MALDI-TOF MS detection (San Diego, CA).\\nThe SNP genotyping call rates ranged from 90% to 99%, with an\\naverage call rate of ,95%. All SNPs were in Hardy Weinberg\\nEquilibrium (HWE) at p.0.05, and all SNPs passed CDC quality\\ncontrol measures based on tests of HWE on the experimental\\nDNA samples and 368 blinded duplicates on CDC-supplied\\ncontrol plates. All genotypes have been deposited into CDC’s\\nGenetic NHANES database and are available for secondary\\nanalysis.\\n\\nStatistical Analysis\\n\\nAll analyses were conducted remotely in SAS v9.2 (SAS\\nInstitute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute,\\nResearch Triangle Park, NC) using the Analytic Data Research by\\n(ANDRE) portal of the CDC Research Data Center in\\nEmail\\nHyattsville, MD.

Furthermore, patients\\non long-term warfarin therapy, of which VKORC1 is the target, have\\non average lower BMD compared with those not on long term\\nwarfarin [7]. Our results suggest that common variants in VKORC1\\nare indeed associated with BMD and perhaps osteoporosis, but many\\nof these results are limited to African Americans. Also, the VKORC1\\nSNPs, while associated at p,0.05, contribute very little to variability\\nof BMD (,1%) compared with other risk factors, making it unlikely\\nthat this locus is a major contributor to BMD as a main effect.\\n\\nThe weak contribution of VKORC1 SNPs on BMD and\\nosteoporosis is not surprising given that BMD and osteoporosis\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org\\n\\n3\\n\\nDecember 2010 | Volume 5 |\\n\\nIssue 12 | e15088\\n\\n\\x0cTable 2.

Twin and family studies suggest 40–80% of the\\nvariability observed in BMD in various study populations can be\\nfor osteoporosis, a\\nattributable to genetics [27–33]. Likewise,\\nfamily history of the condition is strongly associated with cases\\ncompared with controls [34,35]. To date, the genetic component\\ndescribed in these twin and family studies seems to consist of many\\ncommon genetic variants, each with very small effects. That is,\\ncandidate gene [36–39] and genome-wide association studies\\n[28,40–46] have identified .20 genes or genomic regions\\nassociated with hip and spine BMD and/or osteoporosis, each\\nwith effect sizes explaining ,1 to 4% of the variability in BMD or\\nwith an odds ratio of ,1.5 for osteoporosis.\\n\\nThis is the first report of an association between BMD and\\nosteoporosis and these VKORC1 SNPs in the literature. VKORC1\\ngenetic variation on chromosome 16 is not in linkage disequilib-\\nrium with genetic variation known to be associated with BMD\\n(such as ESR1 variants on chromosome 6 [47]) through GWAS\\nand candidate gene studies. Thus, the associations reported here\\ncould represent false-positive findings or could represent associa-\\ntions that fall below the accepted threshold for significance in\\ngenome-wide association studies (p,5.061028). It is interesting to\\nnote, however, that our associations in BMD are mostly limited to\\nAfrican American males. To date, few GWAS studies have been\\nperformed in populations of non-European descent for BMD or\\nosteoporosis, and none have been reported for populations of\\nAfrican-descent. This latter situation has an impact on our ability\\nto replicate the associations described here as GWA studies\\navailable in dbGaP [48], the public repository for genotypes and\\nphenotypes, are not from populations of similar genetic ancestry\\n(i.e., the Framingham Heart Study is of European-descent). For\\nearly replication studies, the preferred sequence of events is to first\\nreplicate and confirm associations in populations of similar genetic\\nancestry before performing characterization studies\\nin other\\nracial/ethnic populations [49].\\n\\nassociations described here. As already previously described\\nthe linkage disequilibrium pattern in VKORC1 differs\\n[3,50],\\nbetween European-descent and African-descent populations, with\\nthe six SNPs\\nthe latter having less pair-wise LD. Four of\\n(rs9923231, rs9934438, rs8050894, and rs2359612) genotyped in\\nNHANES III are in strong LD in the non-Hispanic white\\nsubpopulation, but only two (rs9923231 and rs9934438) are in LD\\nin the non-Hispanic black subpopulation. Intronic rs8050894 is\\nnot in LD with other genotyped VKORC1 SNPs in non-Hispanic\\nblacks and was associated with decreased BMD in males. This\\nSNP, along with the three in LD with it, was not associated with\\nBMD in the non-Hispanic white population. It is possible this\\nindependent association observed in non-Hispanic black males is\\ntagging a genetic variant not genotyped in this study that is more\\ncommon in African-descent populations compared with Europe-\\nan-descent populations. In contrast, the two SNPs in LD in non-\\nHispanic black males were associated with increased BMD, but,\\nagain, neither these SNPs nor the two SNPs in LD with them were\\nassociated with BMD in non-Hispanic whites. The lack of\\nassociation observed in non-Hispanic whites is less straightforward\\ngiven that experimental evidence suggests 59 flanking rs9923231\\naffects VKORC1 gene expression [25]. Nevertheless,\\nis still\\npossible that the association with increased BMD in non-Hispanic\\nblacks also represents an unknown genetic variant tagged by\\nrs9923231 and rs9934438.\\n\\nit\\n\\nIn relation to VKORC1’s association with warfarin dosing, it is\\ninteresting that the minor alleles of rs9923231 and rs9934438 are\\nassociated with increased BMD in non-Hispanic black males. The\\nminor alleles of these two VKORC1 SNPs are also associated with\\ndecreased warfarin dose compared with the major alleles [11].\\nAnd, several studies have shown that these VKORC1 minor alleles\\nare associated with decreased VKORC1 expression in liver [12,25].\\nNHANES III participants are drawn from the general population,\\nso the relationship between warfarin dose, BMD, and VKORC1\\ncould not be directly assessed in this population.\\n\\nIndeed, differences in genetic variation and linkage disequilib-\\nthe population-specific\\n\\nrium patterns may explain,\\n\\nin part,\\n\\nOf note, also,\\n\\nis the sex-specific nature of the associations\\ndescribed here. It is already known that mean BMD differs by\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org\\n\\n5\\n\\nDecember 2010 | Volume 5 |\\n\\nIssue 12 | e15088\\n\\n\\x0cboth sex and race/ethnicity [20,51], and sex differences are also\\nsupported in mouse models [52]. Additionally, previous segrega-\\ntion, linkage, and association studies support sex-specific genetic\\neffects for BMD [53,54] and osteoporosis-related fractures [37]. It\\nis unlikely that power explains the lack of associations observed\\namong non-Hispanic black females given that the sample size for\\nthis subgroup (n = 809) is larger than the non-Hispanic black male\\nsubgroup (n = 619). Also, in adjusted analyses, we included the\\nsame demographic and dietary variables in all sex-specific models,\\nwith the only differences related to female-only variables (such as\\nmenopause, oral contraceptive use, and hormone replacement\\nthe possibility that unknown\\ntherapy). We cannot rule out\\nvariables (confounders) are responsible for the observed associa-\\ntions in males only; nevertheless,\\nthe sex-specific effects are\\nintriguing and warrant further study.\\n\\nThis is a large, population-based study of a diverse sample from\\nthe United States. Despite the strength of sample size for BMD,\\nthis study has several limitations. First, the age range of the study is\\nwide, as participants in NHANES III aged 12 years and greater\\nare available for Genetic NHANES III, and those $20 years have\\nBMD measurements available. Attempts to examine older adults\\nwith BMD are hampered by small sample sizes within any one\\nsubgroup, as evidenced by the small number of cases of\\nosteoporosis. Second, our study is a candidate gene study and\\nnecessarily limited compared with genome-wide association\\nstudies. Third, we did not adjust for multiple comparisons using\\nBonferroni correction given this method is conservative when\\nSNPs are linkage disequilibrium with one another [55]. Even if we\\nchose to adjust using Bonferroni, it is not clear how to implement\\nthis correction given each subpopulation has a distinct pattern of\\nlinkage disequilibrium for this candidate gene [3]. Therefore, we\\npresent here unadjusted p-values. Finally, Genetics NHANES III\\ndoes not have ancestry informative markers or GWAS data\\navailable to adjust for population stratification. We used self-\\nreported race/ethnicity to stratify NHANES prior to analysis.\\nWhile population stratification may still be a concern in this study,\\nit is worth noting that previous studies have found self-reported\\nrace/ethnicity is highly concordant with genetic ancestry deter-\\nmined by genetic markers [56].\\n\\nIn conclusion, we describe several sex- and race/ethnic-specific\\nassociations between BMD and VKORC1 SNPs\\nin adults\\nascertained for a large, population-based cross-sectional survey\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nVKORC1 and Bone Mineral Density in NHANES III\\n\\nof the United States.

            "Because the candidate gene vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) generates vitamin K quinone, a cofactor for the gamma- carboxylation of bone-related proteins such as osteocalcin, we hypothesized that VKORC1 genetic variants may be associated with BMD and osteoporosis in the general population.\n",
            "To test this hypothesis, we genotyped six VKORC1 SNPs in 7,159 individuals from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).\n",
            "NHANES III is a nationally representative sample linked to health and lifestyle variables including BMD, which was measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) on four regions of the proximal femur.\n",
            "In adjusted models stratified by race/ethnicity and sex, SNPs rs9923231 and rs9934438 were associated with increased BMD (p = 0.039 and 0.024, respectively) while rs8050894 was associated with decreased BMD (p = 0.016) among non-Hispanic black males (n = 619).\n",
            "This is the first report of VKORC1 common genetic variation associated with BMD, and one of the few reports available that investigate the genetics of BMD and osteoporosis in diverse populations.\n",

            "Also, some inconsistent evidence suggests long-term warfarin therapy, which by design inhibits the vitamin K cycle and prevents the Glu to Gla modification, is associated with low BMD in patients compared with patients not on warfarin-therapy [5,7].\n",
            "that Despite the discordant observations between humans and macaques, preliminary studies in humans suggest that VKORC1 common variation is associated with mean undercarboyxlated osteocalcin [9] and dietary vitamin K intake [9,10].\n",
            "Based on role of VKORC1 in the vitamin K cycle and based on the preliminary data presented in other studies, we hypothesized that common VKORC1 genetic variation is associated with BMD in humans.\n",
            "To test this hypothesis, we genotyped six VKORC1 SNPs (rs9923231, rs9934438, rs2359612, rs8050894, rs2884737, rs7294) in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and tested for associations with measures of PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 12 | e15088 \fBMD.\n",
            "We also tested for associations between VKORC1 SNPs and osteoporosis, an extreme phenotype of BMD.\n",
            "Unadjusted and adjusted results suggest that VKORC1 SNPs are associated with these bone phenotypes in human, but their effect size is likely small compared with other genetic and non-genetic factors.\n",
            "Materials and Methods Study Population Participants were consented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the time of the survey and sample collection, and consent included the storage of data and biological specimens such as blood for future research [13].\n",

            "A sixth SNP (rs9923231), which is redundant with rs9934438 in both non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, was targeted for genotyping given that there is evidence this is the functional SNP in the association with warfarin dosing [11,25].\n",

            "Adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking status, maternal family history of osteoporosis, thyroid disease, menopause, hysterectomy, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy, education level, alcohol consumption, dietary calcium and vitamin K, and serum levels of vitamin D did not appreciably alter the associations observed in the unadjusted analyses (Table 4).\n",

Crawford1,2*, Kristin Brown-Gentry1, Mark J. Rieder3 1 Center for Human Genetics Research, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America, 2 Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America, 3 Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America Abstract Osteoporosis, defined by low bone mineral density (BMD), is common among postmenopausal women.That is, candidate gene [36–39] and genome-wide association studies [28,40–46] have identified .20 genes or genomic regions associated with hip and spine BMD and/or osteoporosis, each with effect sizes explaining ,1 to 4% of the variability in BMD or with an odds ratio of ,1.5 for osteoporosis.In unadjusted tests of association, only rs7294 was associated with association (p = 0.001) was observed only among non-Hispanic white males (odds ratio = 0.60; 95% confidence interval = 0.45, 0.79; Table S2).It is possible this independent association observed in non-Hispanic black males is tagging a genetic variant not genotyped in this study that is more common in African-descent populations compared with Europe- an-descent populations.n/a n/a n/a n/a 42.21 19.25 (1.48) 972.51 (16.95) 28.32 (0.75) 1.04 (0.01)It is unlikely that power explains the lack of associations observed among non-Hispanic black females given that the sample size for this subgroup (n = 809) is larger than the non-Hispanic black male subgroup (n = 619).Unadjusted and adjusted results suggest that VKORC1 SNPs are associated with these bone phenotypes in human, but their effect size is likely small compared with other genetic and non-genetic factors.Bone mineral content and BMD are available for the femur neck region (gm/cm2), the inter- trochanter region (gm/cm2), the Ward’s triangle region (gm/cm2), and the total region (gm/cm2).In relation to VKORC1’s association with warfarin dosing, it is interesting that the minor alleles of rs9923231 and rs9934438 are associated with increased BMD in non-Hispanic black males.Adjusted and weighted single SNP tests of associations, by race/ethnicity and sex, for bone mineral density total region (gm/cm2).Unadjusted and weighted single SNP tests of associations, by race/ethnicity and sex, for bone mineral density total region (gm/cm2).This is the first report of VKORC1 SNPs associated with BMD; therefore, further studies are required to replicate and characterize the association to establish this candidate gene as a locus relevant to BMD and perhaps associated phenotypes such as osteoporosis.A sixth SNP (rs9923231), which is redundant with rs9934438 in both non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, was targeted for genotyping given that there is evidence this is the functional SNP in the association with warfarinVKORC1 genetic variation on chromosome 16 is not in linkage disequilib- rium with genetic variation known to be associated with BMD (such as ESR1 variants on chromosome 6 [47]) through GWAS and candidate gene studies.Four of (rs9923231, rs9934438, rs8050894, and rs2359612) genotyped in NHANES III are in strong LD in the non-Hispanic white subpopulation, but only two (rs9923231 and rs9934438) are in LD in the non-Hispanic black subpopulation.Also, some inconsistent evidence suggests long-term warfarin therapy, which by design inhibits the vitamin K cycle and prevents the Glu to Gla modification, is associated with low BMD in patients compared with patients not on warfarin-therapy [5,7].(2009) Twenty bone-mineral-density loci identified by large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies.(2009) Twenty bone-mineral-density loci identified by large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies.Based on role of VKORC1 in the vitamin K cycle and based on the preliminary data presented in other studies, we hypothesized that common VKORC1 genetic variation is associated with BMD in humans.Styrkarsdottir U, Halldorsson BV, Gretarsdottir S, Gudbjartsson DF, (2008) Multiple Genetic Loci for Bone Mineral Density Walters GB, et al. and Fractures.For each VKORC1 SNP, unadjusted tests of association for BMD total region were performed assuming additive genetic model stratified by race/ethnicity and sex (Table 3).(2010) PTH and IL21R may underlie variation of femoral neck bone mineral density as revealed by a genome-wide association study.In contrast, the two SNPs in LD in non- Hispanic black males were associated with increased BMD, but, again, neither these SNPs nor the two SNPs in LD with them were associated with BMD in non-Hispanic whites.While population stratification may still be a concern in this study, it is worth noting that previous studies have found self-reported race/ethnicity is highly concordant with genetic ancestry deter- mined by genetic markers [56].Four of these tagSNPs (rs9923231, rs9934438, rs2359612, and rs8050894) are known to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with one another and are associated with warfarin dosing in populations of European-descent [3,11,12].These five tagSNPs also represent the haplotypes associated with warfarin dosing in both non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacksAdditionally, previous segrega- tion, linkage, and association studies support sex-specific genetic effects for BMD [53,54] and osteoporosis-related fractures [37].Volume 5 | Issue 12 | e15088 \\x0cVKORC1 and Bone Mineral Density in NHANES III Table 1.

OR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.87).Nevertheless, is still possible that the association with increased BMD in non-Hispanic blacks also represents an unknown genetic variant tagged by rs9923231 and rs9934438.First, the age range of the study is wide, as participants in NHANES III aged 12 years and greater are available for Genetic NHANES III, and those $20 years have BMD measurements available.VKORC1 rs2884737 was associated with decreased BMD among Mexican-American males (n = 795;

(2010)It is now known that rare mutations in VKORC1 cause warfarin resistance, and common polymor- phisms in VKORC1 account a large proportion of the variability of warfarin dosing in most populations studied [3].VKORC1 SNP rs7294 was no longer associated among non-Hispanic white males.Genome-wide association with bone mass and geometry in the Framingham Heart Study.This latter observation in humans, however, is not supported by recent experiments in male rhesus macaques that demonstrate long-term warfarin therapy does not affect BMD while on a diet high in calcium and vitamin D [8].Our results suggest that common variants in VKORC1 are indeed associated with BMD and perhaps osteoporosis, but many of these results are limited to African Americans.Materials and Methods Study Population Participants were consented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the time of the survey and sample collection, and consent included the storage of data and biological specimens such as blood for future research [13].The heritability of bone mineral density, ultrasound of the calcaneus and hip axis length: a study of postmenopausal twins.We cannot rule out variables (confounders) are responsible for the observed associa- tions in males only; nevertheless, the sex-specific effects are intriguing and warrant further study.Wang X, Kammerer CM, Wheeler VW, Patrick AL, Bunker CH, et al.We then tested for associations between VKORC1 SNPs and osteoporosis, but the results did not mirror the associations observed between VKORC1 and BMD, possibly due to small numbers of cases.Also, the VKORC1 SNPs, while associated at p,0.05, contribute very little to variability of BMD (,1%) compared with other risk factors, making it unlikely that this locus is a major contributor to BMD as a main effect.This SNP, along with the three in LD with it, was not associated with BMD in the non-Hispanic white population.Timpson NJ, Tobias JH, Richards JB, Soranzo N, Duncan EL, et al.The product of VKORC1 is a rate-controlling enzyme in the vitamin cycle and is essential for the production of vitamin-K- dependent, c-carboxylated proteins such as clotting factors II, VII, IX, X protein C, S, andFurthermore, patients on long-term warfarin therapy, of which VKORC1 is the target, have on average lower BMD compared with those not on long term warfarin [7].VKORC1 Common Variation and Bone Mineral Density in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.Previous studies suggested that the vitamin K cycle is essential to the formation of the bone matrix.[48], the public repository for genotypes and phenotypes, are not from populations of similar genetic ancestry (i.e., the Framingham Heart Study is of European-descent).Looker AC, Melton LJ, Harris TB, Borrud LG, Shepherd JA (2010) Prevalence and trends in low femur bone density among older US adults: NHANES 2005CC¸ oˆ2006 compared with NHANES III.(major allele/minor allele) (n = 2,108) (n = 2,073) 59 flanking 0.81/0.18/0.01 0.30/0.50/0.20SNPs were included in both the linear and logistic regression models assuming an additive genetic model (genotypes coded as 0, included in the model without 1, and 2).Because the study investigators did not have access to personal identifiers, this study was considered non-human subjects research by the Vanderbilt University Internal Review Board.SNP rs9923231 (G/A) rs2884737 (A/C) rs9934438 (G/A) rs8050984 (C/G) rs2359612 (G/A) rs7294 (C/T) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0015088.t001 any reason?’’; binary).And, several studies have shown that these VKORC1 minor alleles are associated with decreased VKORC1 expression in liverMeta- analysis of genome-wide scans provides evidence for sex- and site-specific regulation of bone mass.Large-Scale Analysis of Association Between LRP5 and LRP6 Variants and Osteoporosis.In addition to having broad effects on the coagulation cascade, the vitamin K cycle is also essential in the formation of the bone matrix.(2004) Differential Genetic Effects of ESR1 Gene Polymorphisms on Osteoporosis Outcomes.[23] as previously described [3] for non- Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks.Abbreviations: Body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD).Carlson CS, Eberle MA, Rieder MJ, Yi Q, Kruglyak L (2004) Selecting a maximally informative set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms for association analyses using linkage disequilibrium.(n = 2,631), non-Hispanic blacks TagSNPs were selected using LDselect(1998) Updated data on proximal femur bone mineral levels of US adults.Ioannidis JP, Ng MY, Sham PC, Zintzaras E, Lewis CM, et al.

united states of america 3 department of genome sciences university of washington seattle washington united states of america abstract osteoporosis defined by low bone mineral density bmd is common among postmenopausal women the distribution of bmd varies across populations and is shaped by both environmental and genetic factors because the candidate gene vitamin k epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 vkorc1 generates vitamin k quinone a cofactor for the gamma carboxylation of bonerelated proteins such as osteocalcin we hypothesized that vkorc1 genetic variants may be associated with bmd and osteoporosis in the general population to test this hypothesis we genotyped six vkorc1 snps in 7159 individuals from the third national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes iii nhanes iii is a nationally representative sample linked to health and lifestyle variables including bmd which was measured using dual energy xray absorptiometry dexa on four regions of the proximal femur in adjusted models stratified by raceethnicity and sex snps rs9923231 and rs9934438 were associated with increased bmd p  0039 and 0024 respectively while rs8050894 was associated with decreased bmd p  0016 among nonhispanic black males n  619 vkorc1 rs2884737 was associated with decreased bmd among mexicanamerican males n  795 p  0004 we then tested for associations between vkorc1 snps and osteoporosis but the results did not mirror the associations observed between vkorc1 and bmd possibly due to small numbers of cases this is the first report of vkorc1 common genetic variation

have declared that no competing interests exist  email crawfordchgrmcvanderbiltedu introduction the candidate gene vitamin k epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 vkorc1 was first identified as part of the vitamin k epoxide reductase multiprotein complex vkor in 2004 12 the product of vkorc1 is a ratecontrolling enzyme in the vitamin cycle and is essential for the production of vitamink dependent ccarboxylated proteins such as clotting factors ii vii ix x protein c s and z thus vkorc1 has broad implications for clotting a property wellappreciated even before the gene was identified vkor has long been the target of warfarin a commonly prescribed anticoagulant used to prevent stroke and other thromboembolic events it is now known that rare mutations in vkorc1 cause warfarin resistance and common polymor phisms in vkorc1 account a large proportion of the variability of warfarin dosing in most populations studied 3 in addition to having broad effects on the coagulation cascade the vitamin k cycle is also essential in the formation of the bone matrix vitamin k which is synthesized by plants k1 and is a required coenzyme for the c bacteria in the gut k2 carboxylation of three glutamic acid glu residues in osteocalcin converting them to gammacarboxyglutamic acid gla this post translational glu to gla modification of osteocalcin a bone and dentin protein produced by osteoblasts is necessary for calcium binding evidence suggests that vitamin k1 deficiency is associated with decreased bmd 45 and that highdose vitamin k supplementation prevents fractures in atrisk patients 6 also some inconsistent evidence suggests longterm warfarin therapy which by design inhibits the vitamin k cycle and prevents the glu to gla modification is associated with low bmd in patients compared with patients not on warfarintherapy 57 this latter observation in humans however is not supported by recent experiments in male rhesus macaques that demonstrate longterm warfarin therapy does not affect bmd while on a diet high in calcium and vitamin d 8 that despite the discordant observations between humans and macaques preliminary studies in humans suggest that vkorc1 common variation is associated with mean undercarboyxlated osteocalcin 9 and dietary vitamin k intake 910 based on role of vkorc1 in the vitamin k cycle and based on the preliminary data presented in other studies we hypothesized that common vkorc1 genetic variation is associated with bmd in humans to test this hypothesis we genotyped six vkorc1 snps rs9923231 rs9934438 rs2359612 rs8050894 rs2884737 rs7294 in the third national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes iii and tested for associations with measures of plos one  wwwplosoneorg 1 december 2010  volume 5  issue 12  e15088 bmd four of these tagsnps rs9923231 rs9934438 rs2359612 and rs8050894 are known to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with one another and are associated with warfarin dosing in populations of europeandescent 31112 we also tested for associations between vkorc1 snps and osteoporosis an extreme phenotype of bmd unadjusted and adjusted results suggest that vkorc1 snps are associated with these bone phenotypes in human but their effect size is likely small compared with other genetic and nongenetic factors materials and methods study population participants were consented by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc at the time of the survey and sample collection and consent included the storage of data and biological specimens such as blood for future research 13 the present study was approved by the cdc ethics review board because the study investigators did not have access to personal identifiers this study was considered nonhuman subjects research by the vanderbilt university internal review board nhanes iii was conducted between 1988 and 1994 by the national center for health statistics nchs at the cdc nhanes is a nationally representative crosssectional survey designed to represent noninstitutionalized americans at the time of ascertainment 1415 nhanes is also a complex multistage survey that oversamples minorities nonhispanic blacks and mexicanamericans children and the elderly sampling weights are calculated and provided for analysis to account for non response bias and to adjust for the oversampling of specific groups so that all estimates are nationally representative all participants were asked to complete a household interview and physical examination in the mobile examination center mec if the participant was not able to visit the mec a home examination was arranged during phase 2 of nhanes iii 19911994 cell lines were established from blood samples of participants 12 years of age the total number of nhanes iii phase 2 participants was 16530 and sample weights were recalculated using methods previously described 16 for participants with dna samples to avoid nonresponse bias nhanes iii dna samples became available to study investigators beginning in 2002 131719 the trochanter region gmcm2 bmd of the proximal femur was measured during the physical exam on nonpregnant female and male participants at

non hispanic whites and nonhispanic blacks a total of 16 tagsnps were considered for genotyping vkorc1 rs17880887 could not be successfully converted into a genotyping assay and was omitted from further genotyping attempts five tagsnps were targeted for genotyping because they represent the vast majority of common variation in europeandescent populations 3 these five tagsnps also represent the haplotypes associated with warfarin dosing in both nonhispanic whites and nonhispanic blacks 1224 a sixth snp rs9923231 which is redundant with rs9934438 in both nonhispanic whites and nonhispanic

candidate gene vkorc1 in 7159 participants of nhanes iii to determine if these common genetic variants contribute to the variability in bmd in the general population previous studies suggested that the vitamin k cycle is essential to the formation of the bone matrix furthermore patients on longterm warfarin therapy of which vkorc1 is the target have on average lower bmd compared with those not on long term warfarin 7 our results suggest that common variants in vkorc1 are indeed associated with bmd and perhaps osteoporosis but many of these results are limited to african americans also the vkorc1 snps while associated at p005 contribute very little to variability of bmd 1 compared with other risk factors making it unlikely that this locus is a major contributor to bmd as a main effect the weak contribution of vkorc1 snps on bmd and osteoporosis is not surprising given that bmd and osteoporosis plos one  wwwplosoneorg 3 december 2010  volume 5  issue 12  e15088 table 2 study

associated with bmd such as esr1 variants on chromosome 6 47 through gwas and candidate gene studies thus the associations reported here could represent falsepositive findings or could represent associa tions that fall below the accepted threshold for significance in genomewide association studies p5061028 it is interesting to note however that our associations in bmd are mostly limited to african american males to date few gwas studies have been performed in populations of noneuropean descent for bmd or osteoporosis and none have been reported for populations of africandescent this latter situation has an impact on our ability to replicate the associations described here as gwa studies available in dbgap 48 the public repository for genotypes and phenotypes are not from populations of similar genetic ancestry ie the framingham heart study is of europeandescent for early replication studies the preferred sequence of events is to first replicate and confirm associations in populations of similar genetic ancestry before performing characterization studies in other racialethnic populations 49 associations described here as already previously described the linkage disequilibrium pattern in vkorc1 differs 350 between europeandescent and africandescent populations with the six snps the latter having less pairwise ld four of rs9923231 rs9934438 rs8050894 and rs2359612 genotyped in nhanes iii are in strong ld in the nonhispanic white subpopulation but only two rs9923231 and rs9934438 are in ld in the nonhispanic black subpopulation intronic rs8050894 is not in ld with other genotyped vkorc1 snps in nonhispanic blacks and was associated with decreased bmd in males this snp along with the three in ld with it was not associated with bmd in the nonhispanic white population it is possible this independent association observed in nonhispanic black males is tagging a genetic variant not genotyped in this study that is more common in africandescent populations compared with europe andescent populations in contrast the two snps in ld in non hispanic black males were associated with increased bmd but again neither these snps nor the two snps in ld with them were associated with bmd in nonhispanic whites the lack of association observed in nonhispanic whites is less straightforward given that experimental evidence suggests 59 flanking rs9923231 affects vkorc1 gene expression 25 nevertheless is still possible that the association with increased bmd in nonhispanic blacks also represents an unknown genetic variant tagged by rs9923231 and rs9934438 it in relation to vkorc1s association with warfarin dosing it is interesting that the minor alleles of rs9923231 and rs9934438 are associated with increased bmd in nonhispanic black males the minor alleles of these two vkorc1 snps are also associated with decreased warfarin dose compared with the major alleles 11 and several studies have shown that these vkorc1 minor alleles are associated with decreased vkorc1 expression in liver 1225 nhanes iii participants are drawn from the general population so the relationship between warfarin dose bmd and vkorc1 could not be directly assessed in this population indeed differences in genetic variation and linkage disequilib the populationspecific rium patterns may explain in part of note also is the sexspecific nature of the associations described here it is already known that mean bmd differs by plos one  wwwplosoneorg 5 december 2010  volume 5  issue 12  e15088 both sex and raceethnicity 2051 and sex differences are also supported in mouse models 52 additionally previous segrega tion linkage and association studies support sexspecific genetic effects for bmd 5354 and osteoporosisrelated fractures 37 it is unlikely that power explains the lack of associations observed among nonhispanic black females given that the sample size for this subgroup n  809 is larger than the nonhispanic black male subgroup n  619 also in adjusted analyses we included the same demographic and dietary variables in all sexspecific models with the only differences related to femaleonly variables such as menopause oral contraceptive use and hormone replacement the possibility that unknown therapy we cannot rule out variables confounders are responsible for the observed associa tions in males only nevertheless the sexspecific effects are intriguing and warrant further study this is a large populationbased study of a diverse sample from the united states despite the strength of sample size for bmd this study has several limitations first the age range of the study is wide as participants in nhanes iii aged 12 years and greater are available for genetic nhanes iii and those 20 years have bmd measurements available attempts to examine older adults with bmd are hampered by small sample sizes within any one subgroup as evidenced by the small number of cases of osteoporosis second our study is a candidate gene study and necessarily limited compared with genomewide association studies third we did not adjust for multiple comparisons using bonferroni correction given this method is conservative when snps are linkage disequilibrium with one another 55 even if we chose to adjust using bonferroni it is not clear how to implement this correction given each subpopulation has a distinct pattern of linkage disequilibrium for this candidate gene 3 therefore we present here unadjusted pvalues finally genetics nhanes iii does not have ancestry informative markers or gwas data available to adjust for population stratification we used self reported raceethnicity to stratify nhanes prior to analysis while population stratification may still be a concern in this study it is worth noting that previous studies have found selfreported raceethnicity is highly concordant with genetic ancestry deter mined by genetic markers 56 in conclusion we describe several sex and raceethnicspecific associations between bmd and vkorc1 snps in adults ascertained for a large populationbased crosssectional survey references vkorc1 and bone mineral density in nhanes iii of the united states this is the first report of vkorc1 snps associated with bmd therefore further studies are required to replicate and characterize the association to establish this candidate gene as a locus relevant to bmd and perhaps associated phenotypes such as osteoporosis supporting information table s1 pairwise linkage disequilibrium r2 for nhanes iii participants genotyped for six vkorc1 snps by populations docx table s2
